# Hangman

This project is a game developed using C++, based on classic hangman. In this game, player has to guess a secret word in a fixed number of guesses. He would be hanged if he would not be able to guess the letter in available chances. 


# How to play

The game starts with the main menu showing up where player can select his/her choice by entering the serial number corresponding to his/her choice.
If player starts the game, then all the details about his/her level are shown, and a hidden word is displayed, asking for a input(guess). This guess is compared to the secret letters, where, if the player gets it wrong, he/she loses a life, or if the player guesses correctly, then the process will be repeated again until the whole word is guessed.
